<p>Vm3.0.14 is a clean update for any older vm version. We fixed some bugs and added&nbsp;some new features paid by the membership system&nbsp;<a href="http://extensions.virtuemart.net/support/virtuemart-supporter-membership-detail">http://extensions.virtuemart.net/support/virtuemart-supporter-membership-detail</a><br />Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change order status of multiple selected orders in the order list using one simple click</li>
<li>Create links without Category Name and/or without product suffix</li>
<li>product parent id editing field in product edit, so products can be attached to patterns</li>
<li>Product multivariants&nbsp;can use a radiolist instead of dropdowns</li>
<li>PHP7 compatibilty</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very mature release. The maintrunk is already working with the new VMF system which should help to write a bridge for Wordpress. The vm3.1 version is for developers and eager early adopters. For the moment it is the goal, that the whole core works with the new abstraction layer, to concentrate and bundle the bridgeable code.</p>
<p>You should always take&nbsp;a backup of your database. The tableupdater has been&nbsp;strongly enhanced and should handle tables with broken or missing primary fields (fields with auto_increment) a lot better.&nbsp;Note that whilst this has been tested on numerous deployments of VM it is still relatively new.</p>

<p>The critical security leak was already used in the wild. This means it is not a leak, which was disovered by an audit, it is security issue which is already exploited.

<h4>Protect Your Site Now</h4>
<p>If you are a Joomla user, check your logs right away. Look for requests from&nbsp;<span>146.0.72.83</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span>74.3.170.33</span>or&nbsp;<span>194.28.174.106</span>&nbsp;as they were the first IP addresses to start the exploitation. I also recommend searching your logs for “<span>JDatabaseDriverMysqli</span>” or “<span>O:</span>” in the User Agent as it has been used in the exploits. If you find them, consider your Joomla site compromised and move to the remediation / incident response phase.</p>
<p>For securing your joomla 1.5/2.5 pages, just follow this link&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.joomla.org/Security_hotfixes_for_Joomla_EOL_versions">https://docs.joomla.org/Security_hotfixes_for_Joomla_EOL_versions</a>. It is basically replacing one file.</p>
<p>We post this news, because some of our core members discovered this IPs in his logs. Not a VirtueMart page, but as far as we know it wouldnt make a difference.</p></div>";}i:2;O:8:"stdClass":3:{s:4:"link";s:75:"http://virtuemart.net/news/latest-news/474-point-of-sale-pos-for-virtuemart";s:5:"title";s:28:"Point of Sale for VirtueMart";s:11:"description";s:1793:"<div><p><a href="http://www.posforwebshops.com/?aid=3"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="pos for webshops - connect your virtuemart with your brick&amp;mortar store" src="http://virtuemart.net/images/stories/logos/pos_for_webshops.jpg" height="380" width="730" /></a></p>
<p>We are proud to offer the direct link between online and offline sales with VirtueMart &amp; POS for Webshops.</p>
<p>Now there is a complete Point of Sale (POS) available for VirtueMart. When you have a physical store and a VirtueMart webshop you can sell goods with your Point of Sale without giving your sales staff access to the VirtueMart backend. All products / orders / calculation rules / customers will be synchronized into the POS.</p>
<p>The sales staff can check the VirtueMart weborders from the POS and take the goods from the store with the OrderPicker. After an order is picked it will change the order status in Virtuemart automatically into a pre-defined status like “Ready for Shipment”. When new goods arrive from the supplier you can add those to the (VirtueMart) stock just by scanning the product barcode in the Stockmanager.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the Key Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Direct sync with VirtueMart</li>
<li>Easy interface</li>
<li>Different logins</li>
<li>Use VM calculation rules and Shopper Groups</li>
<li>Add customer to an order</li>
<li>Use barcodes to add products to an order.</li>
<li>Customize the sync options with the Payment methods in the POS.</li>
<li>You can print receipts as well as invoices.</li>
<li>Orderpicker and Stockmanger included.</li>
<li>And much more…</li>

<p>The company Qualys.com found a new issue, a possible XSS. It misuses the array keys in the URL. Most servers prevent such an URL by default, but nevertheless we've added another protection. We also found and fixed some smaller bugs and glitches in advanced functions and last but not least we added missing backward compatibility for some cases. This release follows 3 release candidates with more than 2000 downloads altogether.</p>
<h3>New Goal</h3>
<p>Sticking to the Joomla API has emerged as an unlucky decision for us. The future plan is to write more for our own framework VMF, which will give us the freedom to also use other systems than Joomla. The idea is to write a small framework, so that extensions written for VirtueMart should also work on different platforms than Joomla. In other words, instead of developing a standalone VirtueMart, we will try to write an easily bridgeable VirtueMart. We already saw a VirtueMart running on Drupal, so it can't be too hard. But first we want to look into Wordpress. Of course we will need test users and suggestions from developers who are familiar with Wordpress and VirtueMart. So please join our forum if you have some experience with these. We also think about using the Joomla platform by the team of Johan Janssens&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/joomlatools/joomla-platform">https://github.com/joomlatools/joomla-platform</a> for our next full installer.</p>
<h3>New Docs</h3>
<p>Due to our membership system <a href="http://extensions.virtuemart.net/support/virtuemart-supporter-membership-detail">http://extensions.virtuemart.net/support/virtuemart-supporter-membership-detail</a> we did find some time to update our manual. We added a lot of pages, which explain general VirtueMart concepts at <a href="http://docs.virtuemart.net/manual/general-concepts.html">http://docs.virtuemart.net/manual/general-concepts.html</a> - It's worthwhile to read them. Even VirtueMart veterans already found some new tricks in it!</p>

<p>The last stable version vm3.0.8 was 5 months ago. Development has continued during this time, we just spent additional time testing and checking to deliver a more stable version.</p>
<p>We added the ajax script to the cart, so that the new cart is almost like an OPC, you will still add/edit addresses in a separate page. It is backward compatible as long any 3rd party developer/templater uses our javascript handler <a href="http://docs.virtuemart.net/tutorials/development/196-the-vm-javascript-handler.html">http://docs.virtuemart.net/tutorials/development/196-the-vm-javascript-handler.html</a></p>
